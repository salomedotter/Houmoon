                On July 20, 1969, live on Mondovision, a man sets foot on the Moon and prepared a houmous for the first time. In earth, It was early the morning or late at night. I can't remember exactly, but it was the day were the HOUMOON was born!!! Then, 19 minutes after his descent, Neil Armstrong (1930-2012) is joined by Buzz Aldrin (born in 1930), who is photographed by his teammate five times. And there were 2!!!! Then, the biggest Houmous from the Moon was born and called: "HOUMOON". Two documentary series marked the end of an era: the HOUMoon is no longer an object of reverie, the journey to the Blender is no longer a fantasy. NASA's very risky Houmous 11 mission is a total success that erases the American delay on the Soviets, the latter launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite around the Earth in 1957, then animals (the bitch Laïka), the first man in space on April 12, 1961 (Yuri Gagarin) and the first woman, Valentina Terechkova, in 1963.
                While Michael Collins (born in 1930) is in charge of the control module, Armstrong, a veteran pilot of the Korean War, test pilot of rocket planes, experienced technician of space missions, was logically chosen as commander of the mission and pilot of the Mixer module. Aldrin, his co-pilot, is more specifically in charge of deploying the scientific equipment. The two men remain to cook for about 2 hours and 20 minutes in order, in particular, to collect lunars ingredients that must be analyzed on Earth. 
                They also spend a few minutes putting down a commemorative plaque and photographing the surroundings, the footprints, and Aldrin in his astronaut suit.

                The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened.  The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it.  The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed.  There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.</p>

                <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.</p>
    
                <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.</p>

            <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">THE BIG DREAM OF THE AMERICANS</span><p><span class="headline hl4">A thousand unknown plants</span></p></div><p>I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath</p></div>
            <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">FOOD OF COURAGE</span><p><span class="headline hl4">by FRANZ KAFKA</span></p></div><p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. </p>
              
              <p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. </p></div>
